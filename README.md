# hseq
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This program is intended as a more full-featured and
convenient replacement for the UNIX `seq` command and the
`bash` `sequence` built-in. It offers features like
integer/double/alpha/roman elements and an easy choice of
wide versus long format. Many more features are planned, see
below.  These include some features that `seq` has that are
not yet implemented.

Things to add:

  * Format specifiers (for numeric types or in general)
  * Field width control with space-padding and zero-padding
    (at least)
  * Alternate bases for integers
  * Move from `Int` to `Integer` internally for
    arbitrary-precision
